# 42 Basecamp
Exercises made during my 42 Basecamp from 04/04/2022 to 23/04/2022.

This exercises consists in basic shell functions (grep, sed, ifconfig, groups, etc) and some introduction to C language as well as replication of some basic functions. They were my first real contact with C language.
